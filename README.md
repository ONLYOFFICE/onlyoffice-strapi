# ONLYOFFICE plugin for Strapi

This plugin allows users to edit and co-author office files added to the [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) Media Library using ONLYOFFICE Docs.

## Features ‚≠êÔ∏è

The plugin allows to:

- View and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
- Co-edit documents in real time: two co-editing modes (Fast and Strict), Track Changes, comments, built-in chat.

## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

To be able to work with office files within Strapi, you will need an instance of [ONLYOFFICE Docs](https://www.onlyoffice.com/office-suite.aspx). You can install the self-hosted version of the editors or opt for ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud which doesn't require downloading and installation.

### Self-hosted editors

You can install free Community version of ONLYOFFICE Docs or scalable Enterprise Edition.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.

To install Enterprise Edition, follow the instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/installation/enterprise).

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

### ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud

To get ONLYOFFICE Docs Cloud, get started [here](https://www.onlyoffice.com/docs-registration.aspx).

## Plugin installation üì•

1. You need to change the Strapi middlewares file: `strapi/config/middlewares.js`.

   To allow inserting a frame with the editor and loading api.js, replace the `strapi::security` line in this file with the following:

   ```
   {
     name: "strapi::security",
     config: {
       contentSecurityPolicy: {
         useDefaults: true,
         directives: {
           "script-src": ["'self'", "https:", "http:"],
           "frame-src": ["'self'", "https:", "http:"],
         },
       },
     },
   },
   ```

   If such a config already exists, you just need to add `directives`.

2. Install the plugin in your Strapi project:

   ```
   npm install onlyoffice-strapi --save
   ```

3. After successful installation you have to rebuild the admin UI so it'll include this plugin. To rebuild and restart Strapi, run:

   ```
   # using yarn
   yarn build
   yarn develop

   # using npm
   npm run build
   npm run develop
   ```

## Plugin configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

You can configure the ONLYOFFICE plugin via Strapi -> Settings -> ONLYOFFICE PLUGIN -> Configuration. On the settings page, enter:

- **Document server address**: The URL of the installed ONLYOFFICE Docs.
- **JWT Secret**: Starting from version 7.2, JWT is enabled by default and the secret key is generated automatically to restrict the access to ONLYOFFICE Docs and for security reasons and data integrity. Specify your own secret key on the Strapi settings page. In the ONLYOFFICE Docs [config file](https://api.onlyoffice.com/docs/docs-api/additional-api/signature/), specify the same secret key and enable the validation.
